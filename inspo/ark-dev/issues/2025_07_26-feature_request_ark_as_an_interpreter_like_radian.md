Hello! 

I use `radian` in the terminal because it has better code completion and highlighting. I recently noticed that positron has that inbuilt and ended up in this repo. I tried using `ark` in console mode using `jupyter console` but it doesn't seem to have support for code completion and highlighting yet. So I just wanted to make this feature request for using `ark` as the R interpreter in the terminal without the need for positron. I understand that this is not a priority but I just wanted to leave this here for the future.

I think this will be taken care off as part of #699.

Note that this is very low priority for us, as we have more important medium and long term projects to work on.

Yes of course. Like I said I understand that this is not a priority but I just wanted to leave this here for the future.
