It is great for ark to support Jupyterlab.

It seems so far it does not support Jupyterlite (https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite), a serverless Jupyterlab.

If you support Jupyterlite, some new use cases will appear.

Thanks,

Thank you for the suggestion and pointer. Building to wasm is something that we will consider in the future, but not in the short term.
