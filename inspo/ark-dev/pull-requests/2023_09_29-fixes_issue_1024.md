This PR addresses half of the issues reported in #1024, which is that environments always show `??` instead of something useful - see `e` and `test` in this screen shot from the issue:

Now, when there is an environment that is empty, users will see:

When there is an environment that is large (contains more than 1,000 bindings), users will see:

And when there is an environment that contains 1,000 or fewer bindings, the user will see:

I will address the remaining part of #1024 in another PR.
