# Add repo-specific guidance for co-pilot

This adds custom instructions that should improve the quality of the code produced when chatting with copilot.

General documentation on custom instructions:

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization

The repo-specific file that is consulted by default (which is what I'm doing in this PR):

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file

I've seeded this with the little blunders I've been making recently as I develop my ark mojo.

Out of a deep sense of irony and curiosity, I have asked copilot to review this PR. Apparently it has nothing to say on the matter.
