Closes https://github.com/posit-dev/ark/pull/511
Addresses https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/4544

A rework of https://github.com/posit-dev/ark/pull/511 on top of current `main`. The tree-sitter sync up made it rather complicated to merge/rebase, and I had a number of comments so I just did a rewrite here, using Kevin's PR as a very solid base to work from.
