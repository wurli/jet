In the effort to turn off the feature flag for the convert to code feature, I've flipped this to be unsupported for R.

Originally, I had planned for the button to be greyed out, but this change will totally remove the button for R data explorer instances. This seems a bit more obvious that the feature is not available for this data type, rather than just inactive.

Correct!
